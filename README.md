# Craft Summit 2015 - API Code

Here is some code I used for the 2015 Craft Summit.

Some setup notes: 
* in my general.php file, I set `actionTrigger` to `api` so that users could call my controller actions from demo.craft.dev/api/disney/

All of the attraciton content and their respective categorizations are from the [Walt Disney World website](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/), except for the testimonials.
